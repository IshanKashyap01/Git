# Getting Started With Git

- To execute a git command, you must type ```git``` before the commands

```bash
git init
```

1. The ```git``` keyword is recognized by the terminal as a command for git.

2. The ```init``` keyword is a *subcommand* of git

    - It tells git to initialize a *git repository* in the *current working*
    *directory*

- It creates a ```.git``` folder, adds a few configuration files and a subfolder
to store snapshots of our repository

- This folder stores everything git related

**Note:** *Git commands are always lowercase*
