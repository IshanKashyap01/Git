# Standard Operating Procedure: Branches

- As learned in Chapter 2, we create a branch when we need some work done then
merge it with the integration when done

- Similarly, when working with remote repositories, you should branch out from
the integration branch whenever you start some work

- Just like commits, branches in your clones are also private
