# Remote Repository

```bash
$ git remote -v
remote  https://github.com/IshanKashyap01/Git.git (fetch)
remote  https://github.com/IshanKashyap01/Git.git (push)
```

- Git keeps the location of your remote repository when you clone it

- Therefore, when you invoke a ```push``` command, it knows where to send the changes

- Git keeps track of where to pull changes from and where to push them

- By default, both are the same repository you cloned from
